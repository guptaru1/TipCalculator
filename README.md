## Notes

Creating a remote repository through the xcode didn't work for me. I kept on getting an error message saying ""message":"You need at least read:org scope or user scope to list your organizations."" As a result I created the repository through Github directly. I tried to add the settings screen, however in my main.storyboard all the object labels disappared as soon as I linked it.
I implemented the animation for the bill field, I tried doing it for the tip control, however doing it for that the user couldn't select the tip percentage.
